    <h1 class="mb-4">Linux Signals</h1>
    <p>A signal is a notification to a process that an event has occurred. Signals are sometimes described as software interrupts. One process can send a signal to another process.</p>

    <p>Usually kernel is the one that sends signals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware exception occurred</li>
      <li>User typed one of the terminal special characters that generate signals. Interrupt character usually Control-C and suspend character, usually Control-Z.</li>
      <li>Software event occurred. A process time limit was exceeded, child process terminated…</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Signals fall into two broad categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional - standard signals, used by kernel to notify processes or events</li>
      <li>Realtime signals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When a signal is delivered, a process can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignore the signal</li>
      <li>The process is terminated (killed)</li>
      <li>Core dump file is generated, which contains image of the virtual memory of the process, that can be debugged.</li>
      <li>Execution is stopped</li>
      <li>Execution is resumed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Engineers can write a signal handler function, that does some action when signal is delivered.</p>

    <p>Signal handlers are functions that take an integer signal number as an argument. They can be installed using <code>signal()</code> or more robustly via <code>sigaction()</code>.</p>

    <p>Signal masking allows a process to block delivery of specific signals using functions like <code>sigprocmask()</code> or <code>pthread_sigmask()</code>. Signals sent while masked become <strong>pending</strong>, and are only delivered once unmasked.</p>

    <p>The system also provides <strong>default handlers</strong> for every signal type. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>SIGTERM</code>, <code>SIGINT</code>, <code>SIGKILL</code> → terminate by default</li>
      <li><code>SIGSEGV</code> → terminate and create core dump</li>
      <li><code>SIGCHLD</code> → ignored by default</li>
      <li><code>SIGSTOP</code>, <code>SIGCONT</code> → pause and resume, cannot be caught or ignored</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tracing and debugging tools like <code>strace</code> or <code>gdb</code> can be used to monitor signal delivery and handler invocation during execution.</p>

    <h3>Important signal types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SIGINT (Interrupt)</strong> – Sent when you press Ctrl+C in the terminal. Example: <code>ping google.com</code> → press Ctrl+C to stop it.</li>
      <li><strong>SIGHUP (Hangup)</strong> – Sent when a terminal disconnects or to reload daemon configs. Example: <code>sudo kill -HUP $(pidof nginx)</code></li>
      <li><strong>SIGTERM (Terminate)</strong> – Politely asks a process to terminate. Example: <code>kill -TERM &lt;pid&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>SIGKILL (Force Kill)</strong> – Forcefully stops a process immediately. Cannot be caught or handled. Example: <code>kill -9 &lt;pid&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>SIGSTOP and SIGCONT (Stop and Continue)</strong> – Suspend and resume a process. Cannot be caught or ignored. Example: <code>kill -STOP &lt;pid&gt;</code> to pause, <code>kill -CONT &lt;pid&gt;</code> to resume</li>
      <li><strong>SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault)</strong> – Happens when accessing invalid memory. Example: <code>int *p = NULL; *p = 10;</code> (in C)</li>
      <li><strong>SIGCHLD (Child Status Changed)</strong> – Sent to parent when a child process exits. Example: handled in code with <code>signal(SIGCHLD, handler);</code></li>
      <li><strong>SIGALRM (Timer Alarm)</strong> – Sent when an alarm set by <code>alarm()</code> expires. Example: <code>alarm(5)</code> in C sets an alarm after 5 seconds</li>
      <li><strong>SIGUSR1 / SIGUSR2 (User-defined Signals)</strong> – Custom use defined by developer. Example: <code>kill -USR1 &lt;pid&gt;</code> or handled in code with <code>signal(SIGUSR1, handler);</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Signal Handler</strong> is a function that is called when a special signal is delivered to process.</p>

    <p><strong>Sending signal</strong> - one process can send a signal to another process using the <code>kill()</code> system call. <br>
    <code>int kill(pid_t pid, int sig)</code></p>

    <p>For each process the kernel maintains a <strong>signal mask</strong>, a set of signals whose delivery to the process is currently blocked.</p>

    <p>If a process receives a signal that it is currently blocking, that signal is added to the process’s set of <strong>pending signals</strong>.</p>

    <p>Most traditional signals (like SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, etc.) are <strong>not queued</strong>.</p>

    <p>If the same signal is sent multiple times before it’s delivered, only <strong>one instance</strong> is delivered. <br>
    Example: If a process gets 5 SIGTERMs before handling one, it will only receive it once.</p>

    <p>Calling <code>pause()</code> suspends execution of the process until the call is interrupted by a signal handler (or until an unhandled signal terminates the process).</p>

    <p>A signal is a notification that some kind of event has occurred, and may be sent to a process by the kernel, by another process, or by itself. There is a range of standard signal types, each of which has a unique number and purpose.</p>

    <p>Signal delivery is typically <strong>asynchronous</strong>, meaning that the point at which the signal interrupts execution of the process is unpredictable. In some cases (e.g., hardware-generated signals), signals are delivered <strong>synchronously</strong>, meaning that delivery occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain point in the execution of a program.</p>

    <p>By default, a signal either is ignored, terminates a process (with or without a core dump), stops a running process, or restarts a stopped process. The particular default action depends on the signal type.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, a program can use <code>signal()</code> or <code>sigaction()</code> to explicitly ignore a signal or to establish a programmer-defined signal handler function that is invoked when the signal is delivered. For portability reasons, establishing a signal handler is best performed using <code>sigaction()</code>.</p>
