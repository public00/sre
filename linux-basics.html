  <section>
    <h2>Kernel</h2>
    <p>The term kernel is often used as a synonym for the operating system.</p>
    <p>Operating system performs following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Process scheduling - Multiple processes can reside in memory, and each may receive use of the CPU.</li>
      <li>Memory management</li>
      <li>Provision of a file system</li>
      <li>Creation and termination of processes</li>
      <li>Access to devices</li>
      <li>Networking</li>
      <li>Provision of a system call application programming interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Modern processor architectures typically allow the CPU to operate in at least two different modes: User and Kernel mode, which sometimes is referred as supervisor mode.</p>
    <p>A process operates in isolation, and it can’t directly communicate with other processes. A process can’t itself create a new process or even end its own existence.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Shell</h2>
    <p>A shell is a special purpose program designed to read commands typed by a user and execute appropriate programs in response to those commands. It is also known as command interpreter.</p>
    <p>Important shells are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SH</strong> - Bourne shell, is base shell for all the future shells. It has I/O redirection, pipelines, variables, manipulation with env variables..</li>
      <li><strong>BASH</strong> - Bourne again shell, it has additional interactive features.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Users and Groups</h2>
    <p>Users may belong to a group.</p>
    <p>Every user is defined by unique login name and corresponding numeric user ID.</p>
    <p>Groups are useful to organise users. We can put users of a single project in a separate group. Each group is identified by a single line in the system group file, /etc/group which has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group Name</li>
      <li>Group Id</li>
      <li>User List</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Superuser has special privileges in the system, and username is root. It bypass all permission checks in the system.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Single Directory Hierarchy, Directories, Links and Files</h2>
    <p>All files and directories are children of the root directory. Within the system, each file is marked with a type, indicating what kind of file is that.</p>
    <p>A directory is a special file, whose contents take the form of a table of filenames coupled inside.</p>
    <p>Symbolic link provides an alternative name for a file.</p>
    <p>Filename can be up to a 255 characters long.</p>
    <p>Current working directory is current location within the single directory hierarchy.</p>
    <p>File ownership is used to determine the access right available to users of the file.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>File I/O Model</h2>
    <p>Universality of I/O means that the same system calls <code>open()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>close()</code> are used to perform I/O on all types of files, including devices. The kernel translates the application I/O request into appropriate file-system operation.</p>
    <p>File descriptor is obtained by a call to <code>open()</code>, which takes the pathname argument specifying a file upon which I/O is to be performed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Programs</h2>
    <p>Programs normally exist in two forms. The first form is a source code, human readable text, and binary machine-language instructions that the computer can understand.</p>
    <p>Filter is a name often applied to a program that reads its input from stdin, performs some transformation of that input, and writes it to stdout.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Processes</h2>
    <p>A process is an instance of an executing program. Kernel loads the code of the program into virtual memory, allocate space for program variables, and set up kernel bookkeeping data structures to record various information about process.</p>
    <p>When process terminates, all its resources are released for reuse by other processes.</p>
    <p>A process can create a new process using the <code>fork()</code> system call. The process that calls <code>fork</code> is referred to as the parent process. The child inherits copies of the parent's data, stack, and heap segments.</p>
    <p>Each process has a unique integer process identifier (PID).</p>
    <p>A process can terminate in one of the two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By requesting its own termination using the <code>exit()</code> system call.</li>
      <li>By being killed by the delivery of a signal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When booting the system, the kernel creates a special process called <strong>init</strong>, the “parent of all processes,” which is derived from the program file /sbin/init. All processes on the system are created (using <code>fork()</code>) either by init or by one of its descendants.</p>
    <p>A daemon is a special-purpose process that is created and handled by the system in the same way as other processes. It is long-lived (started at system boot and canceled when the system is shut down) and runs in the background.</p>
    <p>Each process has an environment list, which is a set of environment variables that are maintained within the user-space memory of the process.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Memory Mappings</h2>
    <p>The <code>mmap()</code> system call creates a new memory mapping in the calling process’s virtual address space. Mappings fall into two categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A file mapping maps a region of a file into the calling process’s virtual memory. Once mapped, the file’s contents can be accessed by operations on the bytes in the corresponding memory region. The pages of the mapping are automatically loaded from the file as required.</li>
      <li>By contrast, an anonymous mapping doesn’t have a corresponding file.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Interprocess Communication and Synchronization</h2>
    <p>A Linux system runs many processes, some of which need to communicate and synchronize. While file-based communication is possible, it's often too slow. To support more efficient interaction, Linux provides several interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signals – notify processes that an event occurred</li>
      <li>Pipes and FIFOs – transfer data between processes</li>
      <li>Sockets – enable communication between processes on the same or different machines</li>
      <li>File locking – prevents concurrent access to file regions</li>
      <li>Message queues – exchange structured messages between processes</li>
      <li>Semaphores – synchronize process actions</li>
      <li>Shared memory – allows multiple processes to access and modify the same memory region instantly</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Signals</h2>
    <p>Signals in Linux are software interrupts used to notify a process that an event or exceptional condition has occurred. Each signal is represented by an integer constant (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM).</p>
    <p>Sources: Signals can be sent by the kernel, another process (with permissions), or the process itself.</p>
    <p>Examples include pressing Ctrl+C, child process termination, expired timers, or invalid memory access.</p>
    <p>Signals can be sent manually using the <code>kill</code> command or programmatically via <code>kill()</code>.</p>
    <p>Process behavior upon receiving a signal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignore the signal</li>
      <li>Be terminated</li>
      <li>Be suspended (until resumed by another signal)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Custom handling: A process can define a signal handler, a function that executes when the signal is received.</p>
    <p>Pending and blocking: A signal is pending if generated but not yet delivered. Signals can be blocked using a signal mask; blocked signals are held pending until unblocked.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Threads (Extended)</h2>
    <p>Threads in UNIX represent execution units within a process. They share the same address space and resources but maintain separate program counters, stacks, and registers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creation</strong>: Threads are created using libraries like POSIX Threads (pthreads).</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Lightweight, faster to create/destroy than processes, and suitable for parallel tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared memory</strong>: Threads of the same process can access shared global variables without needing IPC mechanisms.</li>
      <li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: Mutexes and condition variables are used to synchronize threads and prevent race conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: Ensuring that functions can be safely invoked by multiple threads simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Threads in UNIX/Linux are lightweight execution units within a process that share the same memory space, including code, data, and heap, but have their own stacks. They communicate through shared global variables and can be synchronized using mutexes and condition variables. Threads are efficient for parallel processing and are ideal for tasks that require shared state and fast communication.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Process Groups and Shell Job Control (Summary)</h2>
    <p><strong>Shell Execution:</strong> Each command or pipeline executed by the shell starts a new process or set of processes. Job Control is the most interactive shells (except the Bourne shell) support job control, letting users run and manage multiple commands concurrently.</p>
    <p><strong>Process Groups:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A group of related processes (e.g., in a pipeline) forms a process group.</li>
      <li>All processes in the group share the same process group ID, typically the PID of the group leader.</li>
      <li>The kernel can deliver signals to all members of a process group, enabling features like pausing or resuming jobs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sessions, Controlling Terminals, and Controlling Processes</h2>
    <p>A session in Linux is a collection of process groups, often created and managed by job-control shells. The shell that starts the session becomes the session leader, and its process ID becomes the session ID. All process groups created by the shell belong to the same session.</p>
    <p>Sessions typically have a controlling terminal, which is the terminal device opened by the session leader—usually the terminal where the user logged in. Only one session can control a terminal at a time. The session leader becomes the controlling process for the terminal and receives a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal if the terminal disconnects.</p>
    <p>Within a session, one process group is designated as the foreground job, which can read from and write to the terminal.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
    <p>A client-server application consists of two components: the client and the server. The client sends a request to the server, which processes the request and sends a response back.</p>
    <p>The client usually interacts with the user, while the server provides access to shared resources, like databases or printers. The client and server can be on the same or different hosts connected by a network.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits of Server:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Managing a resource on a server can be more cost-effective than having it on every client.</li>
      <li><strong>Control & Security:</strong> The server can control access to resources and secure them.</li>
      <li><strong>Heterogeneous Environments:</strong> Clients and servers can run on different hardware or OS platforms while still communicating effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The /proc File System</h2>
    <p>Like several other UNIX implementations, Linux provides a <code>/proc</code> file system, which consists of a set of directories and files mounted under the <code>/proc</code> directory.</p>
    <p>The <code>/proc</code> file system is a virtual file system that provides an interface to kernel data structures in a form that looks like files and directories on a file system. This provides an easy mechanism for viewing and changing various system attributes.</p>
    <p>In addition, a set of directories with names of the form <code>/proc/PID</code>, where PID is a process ID, allows us to view information about each process running on the system.</p>
